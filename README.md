# URL Extractor & ZIP Downloader

This web application allows you to extract URLs from text and download them as a ZIP file. Currently, it supports downloading images from URLs.

I made this tool when I wanted to download some images from my code. Instead of displaying them with HTML, which came with an issue of not all images loading, I fixed it by downloading the images to local files. This is the reasoning behind why I created a URL extractor and zip downloader
